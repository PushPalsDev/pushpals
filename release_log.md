# PushPals CLI Release Log

## Release Metadata

- version: `v1.1.61`
- start_commit: `22fa3a4a02a1e50d7e9aa6a856b8d06c1e6b47f1`
- end_commit: `d8cedc1cb468b408f0c07864f9d57b27ebef5dee`
- commits_in_range: `1`

## Highlights

- Disable PushPals' local session-token pause by default so a static runtime cap does not stop new work while the active Codex/LLM session still has budget.
- Keep LLM usage telemetry for observability while returning `sessionBudget: null` when the local session budget is disabled.
- Preserve explicit local safety caps through `session_token_budget` or `PUSHPALS_SESSION_TOKEN_BUDGET`; configured caps still pause new work after crossing the limit.
- Ship the new default through the packaged CLI runtime and WorkerPal sandbox runtime assets.
- Add route coverage proving large telemetry events do not block follow-up session messages when the local session budget is disabled.

## Validation

- `bun run cli:bundle`
- `bun run cli:verify-package-payload`
- `bun test tests/server.session-message-route.test.ts tests/server.autonomy-store.test.ts`
- `bun run test:root`
- `git diff --check`

## Install

```bash
npm i -g @pushpalsdev/cli
```

```bash
bun install -g @pushpalsdev/cli
```

## Artifacts

- `SHA256SUMS.txt`

## Breaking Changes

- None.

## Known Issues

- Docker-backed WorkerPal execution still requires Docker to be installed and running when WorkerPal auto-spawn is enabled; `pushpals --clear` cleanup is best-effort when Docker is unavailable or times out.
- The npm package still requires a working Bun runtime to launch the package entrypoint; PushPals does not vendor Bun or other external toolchains in the npm package.
- Direct GitHub release binaries are PushPals-built standalone artifacts. Removing embedded Bun runtime from those standalone artifacts would require a separate runtime distribution redesign.
- Active runtimes that were started from an older release must be restarted after installing this release before new startup or packaged-runtime behavior takes effect.
- PushPals does not currently read Codex TUI `/status` directly; by default it avoids enforcing an independent local session-token pause and relies on the active Codex/LLM provider budget. Users who need a local safety cap can set `session_token_budget` or `PUSHPALS_SESSION_TOKEN_BUDGET`.
- Docker-backed WorkerPal execution can use a stalled Docker Codex startup as the signal to switch future WorkerPal spawns to direct isolated-worktree execution; if the replacement direct WorkerPal also cannot start Codex, that retry can still fail terminally and recycle the worker.
- QualityGate can still reject or request repair for a broad patch after the rollout coach hands publishable progress forward; this release changes the failure point from executor pre-validation failure to structured gate diagnostics.
- Bun dependency-layout preflight is offline and lockfile-frozen; if the local Bun cache is incomplete or the lockfile cannot be satisfied, ValidationGate will continue and report the dependency/setup blocker rather than modifying project manifests.
- Expo Router browser validation now removes linked `node_modules` artifacts before dependency repair; if the offline Bun cache is incomplete, the browser validation may still report a local dependency/setup blocker.
- Critic-only soft-pass applies only after required validation passes; a low critic score can still block when there is enough budget for another revision, when deterministic gates find issues, or when exhausted soft-pass is disabled.
- Codex `gpt-5.5` requires a recent Codex CLI; older Codex CLIs fall back to `gpt-5.4` for WorkerPal and RemoteBuddy Codex execution when they report model incompatibility.
- GitHub contribution credit for WorkerPal commits requires the configured commit email to be associated with the target GitHub account.
- User-local `runtime/configs/local.toml` overrides can preserve older runtime defaults during manual smoke testing; use `pushpals --clear` or remove the local override to pick up new packaged defaults.
- Some Windows Git installations may need Schannel certificate handling for remote operations, for example `git -c http.sslBackend=schannel fetch origin`.
